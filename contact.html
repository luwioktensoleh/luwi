		Please ensure you are using your registered e-mail address and correct password. Note that the password is case sensitive.

If you’ve registered for the first time this season, you will need to activate your account before entering a Fantasy Premier League team. 
An email will be sent to the email address you’ve registered with and contains a link you’ll need to click in order to activate your account. 
If you haven’t received an email, please check your spam or junk mail folders.

Try resetting your password. A temporary password will be sent to your mailbox. Please update your password once logged in.

If you do not receive the password reminder, please check your Junk folder in your email inbox and add noreply@mailout.users.

		Some users with Hotmail/Outlook addresses have reported issues with receiving emails due to them being blocked by spam filters. 
		To resolve this you need to set the Premier League as a safe sender in your settings. To do this complete the following steps:

Outlook.com (Formerly Hotmail)

1. Open your Outlook mailbox.

2. Select Options from the top right (next to the question mark).

3. Select More options > Safe and blocked senders (under Preventing junk email) > Safe senders.

4. In the space provided, enter the address - noreply@mailout.users.premierleague.com

5. Select Add to list.

6. Ensure the safe mailing lists box has the address you entered, and select OK.

Once this has been completed, please go back to the FPL site and follow the 'Forgot your password?' steps again.

You should find that the email is then sent to your inbox. Please note that this can take up to 10 minutes to come through.

		<p class="quest">
			I have set up a team, but I can't see my history or renew my leagues from previous seasons. Can you link my new account to my old one?
		</p>
		<p class="jawaban">
		Unfortunately, we cannot link your history from an old account to a new one. If you have set up a team for this season using a different email address, 
		you will not be able to view your history from previous seasons on that account.

In order to see previous seasons' scores, you will need to sign in on the homepage using the registered 
email address and password combination from the previous seasons and set up a team using that account.

		</p>
		<p class="jawaban">
